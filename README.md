# API_AviationStack_test
Simple test of the API with some data manipulation afterwards

This notebook:
- Retrieves 10 records of active flights, 
- Selects a subset of columns, 
- Renames columns
- Modifies some column data
- Calculates the size of the data batch

Considerations:
- The API_ACCESS_KEY should be provided as a os env variable.
